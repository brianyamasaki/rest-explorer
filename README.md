## Installation

Creating this project requires [Node](http://www.nodesjs.org), followed by [Yarn](http://www.yarnpkg.com). Node is best supported on Linux and MacOS, though by installing long file names (paths > 256 chars) it might work on Windows.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brianyamasaki/rest-explorer.git
cd rest-explorer
yarn
```

## Get started

Starting the Development server is done by the following

```bash
yarn start
```

Creating an optimized release version is done by the following

```bash
yarn build
```

This project is built using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) so you will want to read that User Guide for more goodies.
